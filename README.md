### MultiLabel Classification problem

* XgBoost parameter training framework [Notebook](https://github.com/Seeker875/MoADrugDiscovery/blob/master/dev/xgBoostParamTune.ipynb)

* MultiLabel model training with TensorFlow [Notebook](https://github.com/Seeker875/MoADrugDiscovery/blob/master/dev/tfForAllVars.ipynb)

* Bash Venv [file](https://github.com/Seeker875/MoADrugDiscovery/blob/master/venv.sh) for setting Python Environment

In current approaches for Drug discovery, Scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.

Effects of a drug on the protien target

**Independent variables** are Quantile normalized

**Metric** is average logloss for all labels/classes

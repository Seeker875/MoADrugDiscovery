# Mechanisms of Action Drug Discovery 

### MultiLabel Classification problem

[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/data)

In current approaches for Drug discovery, Scientists seek to identify a protein target associated with a disease and develop a molecule that can modulate that protein target. As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.

Effects of a drug on the protien target

**Independent variables** are Quantile normalized

**Metric** is average logloss for all labels/classes
